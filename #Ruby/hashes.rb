# Ruby includes two hash methods, .each_key and .each_value, that do exactly what you'd expect:

  memento: 3,
  primer: 3.5,
  the_matrix: 3,
  truman_show: 4,
  red_dawn: 1.5,
  skyfall: 4,
  alex_cross: 2,
  uhf: 1,
  lion_king: 3.5
}

movie_ratings.each_key { |title| puts title }

# iterating over hashes
secret_identities = {
  "The Batman" => "Bruce Wayne",
  "Superman" => "Clark Kent",
  "Wonder Woman" => "Diana Prince",
  "Freakazoid" => "Dexter Douglas"
}
  
secret_identities.each do |hero,name|
    puts "#{hero}: #{name}"
