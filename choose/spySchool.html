Nonetheless, Riker retains a willingness to occasionally disregard the chain of command.

In the episode, Riker's estranged father, Kyle, visits the Enterprise to offer his son the command of the USS Aries, which Riker refuses. We learn that Riker grew up in Valdez, Alaska; that his mother, Elizabeth, died when he was two years old; and that he was raised by his father until the age of 15, when he left home. In the episode, Riker had not spoken with his father for 15 years, but they manage to partially mend their relationship over a game of martial-arts sparring called Anbo-jitsu. In the episode "Lower Decks" a waiter at Ten Forward mistakenly states that Riker is Canadian. According to the Voyager episode "Death Wish" (which Riker made a guest appearance in), Riker's distant ancestors also lived in the United States: during the American Civil War, his ancestor Colonel Thaddius Riker fought on the Union side, as an officer in the 102nd New York Infantry Regiment during the Atlanta Campaign.</p>							</div>									<div class="choice">				<a href="#backtrack">eat your pie</a>				<a href="#noise">find a boat</a>										</div>			<hr>								</div>					<!------ PART ------------>					<div class="sixteen columns center">						<a name="backtrack"></a>						<div class="main">							<p>You find yourself lost in a forest.
